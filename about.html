                    <p>In China, beverages are meant to be both thirst quenching and healthy. Tea is brewed to help the the body repair and rebuild after stress and illness.</p>

                    <p>Wise Mouth Tea, the American descendant of a long line of Chinese tea makers, is grounded in this very philosophy. Each variety is inspired by ancient Chinese medicine, and made with only real ingredients, including plants with traditional medicinal value.</p>

                    <p>There are no preservatives, no additives and no concentrates.</p>

                    <p>Owner/founder Lei Nichols learned the art of Chinese tea from her parents and grandparents. As a small child in the remote Chinese village of Shanzui (山嘴), Lei helped her grandmother dry chrysanthemum leaves in the sun to be used as part of a healing tea.</p>

                    <p>After moving to America and becoming a high school teacher, Lei noticed how many unhealthy drinks her students were consuming–so she decided to do something about it!</p>

                    <p>Today, Massachusetts-based Wise Mouth Tea offers a variety of delicious iced teas and fruit drinks with unique flavors and healthy ingredients, available in stores and online. Each batch is made with love, every sip is a gift from nature.</p>

                    <p>Life is short! Treat yourself to a delicious Wise Mouth Tea today!</p>
